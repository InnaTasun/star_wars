    `When Lucas was working with Terry McGovern in THX 1138, McGovern said, 
    "I think I ran over a wookiee back there." Lucas asked what a "wookiee" was, 
    and McGovern admitted that he made up the word. Lucas never forgot the word, 
    and decided to use it in the film.`,

    `The famous droid used to be able to speak in English with C-3PO, and he was 
    actually going to curse a lot, but his dialogue was removed in post-production 
    and replaced with his iconic beeps.`,

    `Lucas was struggling with writer's block while writing the script, and his wife, 
    Marcia, who also edited the film, suggested that C-3PO get shot.`

    `In an interview with Leonard Maltin, Lucas admitted that he wanted Muppets maestro 
    Jim Henson to play the role of Yoda. “I went to Jim [Henson] and said, ‘Do you want 
    to do this?’ And he said, ‘Well, I’m busy, I’m doing this, and doing that, I’m making 
    a movie and all that—I really can’t, but ... how about Frank [Oz]? You know, 
    Frank’s the other half of me.’ And I said, ‘Well, that’d be fantastic.’”.`,

    `Harrison Ford, the actor who played Han Solo, is 6'1", whereas Carrie Fisher, 
    the actress who played Leia, is only 5'1". In order to make the two look closer in height, 
    Fisher usually had to stand on a box while filming her scenes with Ford.`,

    `One of the more meaningful themes in The Empire Strikes Back involves what 
    is beyond the surface, or more pertinent to the theme: understanding that 
    superficial judgments about what one sees is not always a clear picture. 
    The clearest example is that of the diminutive Jedi Master, Yoda.`

    `The film's working title was "Blue Harvest". After the success of Star Wars 
    and The Empire Strikes Back, Lucasfilm wanted to keep the film's production 
    from fans and journalists in order to stop on-set secrets from getting leaked. 
    So, during the making of the movie, they pretended they were making a horror 
    film called Blue Harvest, and had all the Jedi crew members wear Blue Harvest shirts. 
    The tagline? "Horror beyond imagination." `,

    `The blockbuster credit featuring a slowly building deafening sound punctuated by the 
    letters “T-H-X” is near-ubiquitous these days, but Return of the Jedi was the first 
    film to use the cutting-edge movie sound certification.`,

    `The voice of Boushh, Princess Leia's bounty hunter disguise when she’s trying 
    to free Han Solo from Jabba's Palace, is Pat Welsh, the same radio actress 
    who was the voice of E.T. in 1982's E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial.`

    `During the scene with the Galactic Senate, there is a shot where if you look 
    at the bottom-left corner of the screen, you can see E.T., and a few of his friends 
    participating in the meeting. His species of alien is known as "Asogians," 
    and this was done by George Lucas to pay Steven Spielberg back for putting 
    a Yoda cameo in his film, E.T. the Extraterrestrial.`,

    `Michael Jackson wanted a role in the film.`,

    `It's the first Star Wars film to show a lightsaber being activated every time.`

    `Attack of the Clones was the first Star Wars film to use a high-definition 
    digital 24-frame system for most of the its live-action scenes. 
    The film was a financial success, grossing over $600 million at the worldwide box office. 
    However, for the first time, a Star Wars film did not earn the highest 
    box-office sales for the year.`,

    `The scene where Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan travel in an elevator at the start 
    of Episode II wasn't in the original script. George Lucas wanted to add an introductory 
    scene to the movie to show how well these two characters get along, 
    even though there is a little tension between them in the scene that follows.`,

    `The calm Kaminoan race appears briefly in Attack Of The Clones. 
    They are a very graceful and serene alien race -- but they were completely CG in the movie. 
    Fashion models and the elegance of tai chi inspired the movie's animators 
    in creating Kaminoan characters Taun We and Lama Su.`

    `In total, 72 sets were created for Star Wars: Revenge Of The Sith. 
    The largest set was the stage where Anakin Skywalker has an epic 
    lightsaber battle with Count Dooku (played by Christopher Lee in the movie).`,

    `One of the iconic elements in Revenge of the Sith is General Grievous, 
    complete with his hacking cough and his love of lightsaber collecting. 
    During post-production, George Lucas developed a rather nasty cough. 
    They had an idea. They recorded the cough, filtered and mixed it, 
    and used it as General Grievous’ hacking bark. `,

    `On major film sets, there are usually multiple directors. 
    George Lucas directed this film but he had his old friend Steven Spielberg 
    help him out as a second unit director. Steven Spielberg helped out 
    with the iconic lightsaber duel between Anakin and Obi-Wan, which, 
    let’s be honest, is one of the best parts of the entire film.`
